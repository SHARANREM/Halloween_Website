            <h1>The Origins and Evolution of Halloween</h1>
            <p>Halloween began as the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, a time to celebrate the harvest and protect
                against roaming spirits. Over centuries, with Christian influence and American cultural additions,
                Halloween
                grew into a beloved holiday worldwide, celebrated with costumes, trick-or-treating, and spooky
                festivities.
            </p><br><br><br> <br><br>
            <p class="high">
                Halloween has deep-rooted origins, tracing back over 2,000 years to the ancient Celtic festival of
                Samhain (pronounced "sow-in"). Celebrated on October 31, Samhain marked the end of the harvest season
                and the beginning of winter—a time often associated with death. The Celts, who primarily lived in what
                is now Ireland, the United Kingdom, and northern France, believed that on this night, the boundary
                between the living world and the spirit world blurred, allowing ghosts and other spirits to cross over
                into the human world. To ward off these spirits and protect their households, people would light large
                bonfires and wear costumes made of animal skins and heads to disguise themselves and confuse wandering
                spirits.
                <br><br>
                As Christianity spread through Europe, Samhain began to merge with Christian traditions. By the 8th
                century, Pope Gregory III designated November 1 as All Saints' Day—a day to honor saints and martyrs—and
                the evening before became known as All Hallows’ Eve, eventually evolving into Halloween. This fusion of
                traditions aimed to Christianize the festival, but many Celtic customs persisted, blending religious and
                folk practices.
                <br><br>
                In the Middle Ages, Halloween continued to evolve. People would dress as saints, angels, and demons to
                take part in "mumming" and "souling" rituals, visiting houses to recite verses or perform in exchange
                for food or “soul cakes.” This practice is often viewed as an early version of trick-or-treating,
                emphasizing communal interaction and neighborly charity.
                <br><br>
                Halloween arrived in North America in the 19th century, carried by Irish immigrants fleeing the Great
                Famine. They introduced traditions like carving jack-o'-lanterns, which originated from the Irish tale
                of “Stingy Jack,” a man doomed to wander with only a carved turnip to light his way. In the U.S.,
                pumpkins—native to America and larger than turnips—became the go-to choice for carving, giving us the
                classic jack-o'-lantern.
                <br><br>
                By the early 20th century, Halloween had become more community-oriented in America, moving away from
                superstitions to embrace fun, games, and neighborhood gatherings. During the 1920s and 1930s, Halloween
                parties and parades became common, especially for children. Trick-or-treating gained popularity in the
                1950s, combining costumes and door-to-door visits, making Halloween a holiday focused on fun and candy.
                <br><br>
                In the 1970s and beyond, Halloween saw a cultural explosion, driven largely by horror films like
                Halloween (1978) that solidified its spooky reputation. Haunted houses, costumes influenced by pop
                culture, and celebrations expanded globally, with many countries now observing Halloween through costume
                parties, parades, and themed events.
                <br><br>
                Today, Halloween is one of the most celebrated holidays, blending elements of ancient customs, Christian
                influence, and American commercial culture. It allows for creativity, expression, and, for one night, a
                chance to become someone—or something—else entirely.
